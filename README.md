# Zowe Client SDK for Java

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.zowe.client.java.sdk/zowe-client-java-sdk.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22org.zowe.client.java.sdk%22%20AND%20a:%22zowe-client-java-sdk%22)
[![javadoc](https://javadoc.io/badge2/org.zowe.client.java.sdk/zowe-client-java-sdk/javadoc.svg)](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.zowe.client.java.sdk/zowe-client-java-sdk)

This Java SDK is a sub-project of Zowe, focusing on modernizing mainframe experience. Zowe is a project hosted by the Open Mainframe Project, a Linux Foundation project.  

Version 1.0 provides functionality documented in [MVP issue](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-client-java-sdk/issues/5). Project requires Java 11 and above. 

The SDK lets you leverage the underlying z/OSMF REST APIs on a z/OS system to build applications that interface with your z/OS instance.

The goal is to provide Java developers an SDK to easily interface with a backend mainframe from any computer that has a JVM. The SDK will do the leg work to allow you to interface with z/OS services. These services provides access to the mainframe in ways where you can build automation, testing, and devOps applications without the need to build those directly on the mainframe itself, and as such, opens these applications to modern tools.  

Functionality provided:

    GetJobs   
    IssueCommand (mvs commands)  
    IssuesTsoCommand  
    SubmitJobs  
    DownloadDataset  
    CreateDataset  
    DeleteDataset  
    WriteDataset  
    ListDataset  
    MonitorJobs  
    CopyDataset
    CancelJobs
    DeleteJobs
    CheckStatus
    ListDefinedSystems
      
## Requirements  
    
    Maven  
    Java 11  
    z/OSMF installed on your backend z/OS instance.  
  
## Code Samples  

[Samples](https://github.com/frankgiordano/zowe-client-java-sdk-examples)    
   
## Demo App  

[ZosShell](https://github.com/frankgiordano/ZosShell)
    
## Build
  
The following maven command at the root prompt of the project will produce zowe-client-java-sdk.jar in the target directory:
  
    mvn clean package  
  
## Logger 

In your project consuming this SDK, you will need to implement a logging framework. 

SLF4J is in place for logging APIs within this SDK.   
  
SLF4J stands for Simple Logging Facade for Java. It provides a simple abstraction of all the logging frameworks.   
  
As such, as needed in your parent project implement a logging framework which wraps around SLF4j, for instance logging frameworks such as Log4j2, Logback, JUL (java. util. logging), etc.
