This project is a subproject of Zowe, focusing on modernizing the mainframe experience. Zowe is a project hosted by the Open Mainframe Project, a Linux Foundation project.

The Java SDK lets you leverage the underlying z/OSMF REST APIs on a z/OS system to build client applications and scripts that interface with your z/OS instance seamlessly.

For instance, one API package provides the ability to upload and download z/OS data sets. You can leverage that package to rapidly build a client application that interacts with data sets.

The Java SDK joins an existing community of other language-specific SDKs. It provides the Java community with similar capabilities based on the NodeJS SDK. 
  
This SDK may differ from some others with the JobMonitor class adding prebuilt functionality for automation tasks.  
  
Issues worked on documenting the main feature set provided can be viewed within the following MVP issues:  
[#1](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-client-java-sdk/issues/5) [#2](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-client-java-sdk/issues/219) [#3](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-client-java-sdk/issues/281) [#4](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-client-java-sdk/issues/338)

## TeamConfig Package  
  
The TeamConfig package provides API methods to retrieve a profile section from Zowe Global Team Configuration with keytar information to help perform connection processing without a hard coding username and password. Keytar represents credentials stored securely on your computer when performing the Zowe Global Initialize [command](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-using-initializing-team-configuration/) which prompts you for username and password.   
  
TeamConfig class only supports Zowe Global Team Configuration provided by Zowe V2.  
  
With Zowe CLI and Global Team Configuration initialized, you can use TeamConfig API methods to retrieve a profile type which will include the secure username and password information stored in our OS credential store manager.   
  
You can use this information to create a dynamic ZosConnection object to perform zosmf authentication for all the other packages. This avoids the need to hard code values.    
  
See the following package/class:  
  
zowe.client.sdk.teamconfig  
    
    TeamConfig
    
NOTE:  
Whenever you encounter a JSON parse error for reading the Zowe Team Configuration file, make sure to include double quotes around keys and its values.  
  
## Http Rest Processing
  
SDK release version 2 uses Unirest 3.x Http functionality.  
  
SDK release version 3 and above uses Unirest 4.x, which removes the dependency on Apache Commons and provides token processing for Web TOKEN authentication.   
   
Unirest's library provides the ability to retrieve an IBM z/OSMF JSON error document.  
  
For example, the following http GET request will result in an HTTP 500 error:  
  
    https://xxxxxxx.xxxxx.net:xxxx/zosmf/restfiles/ds?
  
and the JSON error report document body response is:  
  
    {"rc":4,"reason":13,"category":1,"message":"query parm dslevel= or volser= must be specified"} 

## Authenticating to z/OSMF
  
Since the release of the SDK, the authentication of each REST API call is done with BASIC authentication.
  
With SDK release version 3, Web TOKEN authentication was added.   
  
The current version 4, SSL authentication from a certificate file was added.  
  
With three types of authentication available, the AuthType enum class was introduced to represent each type.    
  
This enum is used to send it to the ZosConnection constructor denoting the type of authentication to perform.  

For BASIC, the following ZosConnection object is specified to perform BASIC authentication:  
  
    ZosConnection connection = ZosConnectionFactory.createBasicConnection("host", "zosmfPort", "user", "password");
  
Basic authentication means that the http request contains a BASIC header representing the username and password encrypted.   
  
For web TOKEN, the following ZosConnection object is specified:  
  
    ZosConnection connection = ZosConnectionFactory.createTokenConnection("host", "port", new Cookie("xxx", "xxx")));
  
With the zosmfauth package, ZosmfAuth provides an API (zosmfLogin) to retrieve authentication tokens (a JSON Web and an LTPA TOKEN) on a BASIC authentication request. This package contains an API that can also be used to delete the current store of JSON Web and LPTA tokens.  
  
See the README.MD in the zosmfauth package for code examples on retrieving an initial token and then using it for further requests without needing user and password information.  
  
Web TOKEN support must be enabled on your z/OSMF system. For more information, see Enabling JSON Web TOKEN support in the IBM z/OS Management Facility Configuration Guide.  

See [README.md](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-client-java-sdk/blob/main/src/main/java/zowe/client/sdk/zosmfauth/README.md) in zosmfauth package for further details.     
  
For SSL, the following ZosConnection object is specified:  

    ZosConnection connection = ZosConnectionFactory.createSslConnection("host", "port", "c:\file.p12", "certpassword"));
  
The SDK supports .p12 file format that represents a key-store that houses a certificate.  
  
In the example above, for certFilePath specify a path with a file name representing the location and file name of the .p12 file.  
  
For certPassword, specify the paraphrase/password used for the key store.  
  
For a self-signed certificate, you will need to enable inSecure processing by setting the following system property:  
  
    zowe.sdk.allow.insecure.connection  
  
to true value.  
      
See [README.md](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-client-java-sdk/blob/main/src/main/java/zowe/client/sdk/zosmfauth/README.md) in zosmfauth package for further details.

## Build  

Java 11 and above is required to compile JAR file. Maven is required to build JAR file.     
  
The following maven command at the root prompt of the project will produce zowe-client-java-sdk.jar in the target directory:
  
    mvn clean package  
  
## Logger 
     
For logging, the SDK does NOT include SLF4j (Simple Logging Facade for Java) dependency within its FATJAR. 
  
You will need to add SLF4j dependency and plug into your SLF4J by implementing a logging framework of your choice for your project.

## Maven Central Publication  

https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.zowe.client.java.sdk/zowe-client-java-sdk  

## Install Java SDK from an online registry

To install this library in your project, use a build tool such as Maven, Gradle or Ant. Use the following link to get the necessary artifact:

https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.zowe.client.java.sdk/zowe-client-java-sdk

For a Maven project add the SDK as a dependency by updating your `pom.xml` as follows:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.zowe.client.java.sdk</groupId>
        <artifactId>zowe-client-java-sdk</artifactId>
        <version>4.3.0-RC2</version>
    </dependency>

For a Gradle project add the SDK as a dependency by updating your `build.gradle` as follows:

    implementation group: 'org.zowe.client.java.sdk', name: 'zowe-client-java-sdk', version: '4.3.0-RC2'  
  
## Publishing to Maven Central  
  
The following documents the steps taken to publish a new release of this project to maven central:
  
- Start the following process on your machine:
  
      gpg-agent --daemon
  
  
- Execute the following maven build and deploy command at the project's root directory:
  
      mvn clean deploy -Pci-cd
  
  You will be prompted for a passphrase for uploading.
  
   
- Login to the following website:
  
      https://central.sonatype.com/
  
- Navigate to the Publish section within the website.

    
- In Publishing Settings, see the Deployments section and click on the Publish button for the release that was uploaded. 
   
NOTE: For the publishing to work fully, you will need to add a server section in your maven settings.xml file that contains an id of central with username and password values.  
    
The username and password values are generated by maven central repository as a portal token for publishing and specified within the server section of settings.xml.  
  
See https://central.sonatype.org/publish/generate-portal-token/  
  
See the settings.xml example described in the next section.   
    
## Maven settings.xml  
  
This project contains maven plugins within the pom.xml. Some of these require the maven2 repository. As such, the settings.xml file for your maven setup needs to have a maven2 repository specified.  
  
Within the project's root directory, a settings_example.xml is available as a template for this project usage within your local development environment.
